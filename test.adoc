Pleasanton, CA

I'm a Ruby/Python developer. I wrote my own simple compiler, developed
an agile plugin, automated my tennis court reservations, as well as
won the academic excellence award for best strategic plan from the
University of the Philippines School of Management. My professional life
is guided by my desire to continually make myself better at creating and
delivering quality software.

== Accomplishments

- *Increased Module Accuracy and Speed by at Least 10x* - I offered  to
re-design and re-implement a cloud computing application's billing module
which was producing incomplete results and regularly timing out before it
could even display half of an account's report. After I redesigned it, the
reports were displayed immediately, and the amounts were 100% accurate.

- *Facilitated Timely Delivery of Software By Automating Requirements* - My
employer needed to deliver an autonomous software agent for a customer. I
offered to study the associated open standards and proprietary protocols to
learn about the complete requirements. I then codified these requirements in
an application that developers can execute against their code to give them
instant feedback. The application later also served as a regression test
harness allowing the team to deliver the software on time and within budget.

- *Reduced a 2-day Manual Process to 5-seconds* - While building the MIS for
a metal fabrication shop, I learned about a manual computation process that
took shop floor engineers 2 days to complete. After some research and a few
questions on a compsci newsgroup, I was able to build a desktop app that reduced
the computation time to 5 seconds.

- *Improved Requirements Gathering Through Prototyping* - Upon joining a new
software consulting firm, I noticed the long feedback loop from requirements
gathering to user testing. I encouraged and guided my teammates to adopt
prototyping as one of the ways to improve requirements gathering and reduce
waste. The results were positive and the engineers along with the users were
very happy with the results.

- *Recipient of Academic Excellence Award for Best Strategic Plan* - I wanted
to understand the business of software and decided that focusing on the basics of
business management was key. I then applied for our state university's graduate
program for management where I was accepted. During the program, I was top of
class for Operations Management, Financial Management, and Business Strategy. I
then used everything that I learned to create a strategic plan for our family
business which resulted in me getting the strategic plan award.

== A Few Open Source Projects

- *Open vSwitch Lab* - A Vagrant project that provisions two machines that talk
over a simulated Internet. The lab is a companion project for the series of
articles I wrote about http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovs-lab.html[VXLAN], http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovsdb.html[OVSDB], and http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/hardware_vtep.html[the hardware VTEP schema]. link:https://github.com/relaxdiego/ovs-lab[Source in Github].

- *Aviator* - A lightweight Ruby client library for cloud REST APIs. I initially
built this for the OpenStack API. My focus was to build a library that reflected,
rather than obscured the underlying API. link:http://aviator.github.io/www/[Homepage].

- *Redmine Backlogs* - Redmine is an open software configuration management
application. I built an agile plugin for it called Redmine Backlogs. These days,
it is being maintained by a self-managing community at http://www.redminebacklogs.net
and has also be forked by other projects such as https://www.openproject.org/features/agile-scrum/[OpenProject].

- *Mana Mana* - A proof-of-concept business natural language testing framework
that was inspired by Cucumber and the Robot framework. This was borne of my
never-ending search for better ways to write maintainable automated tests. link:https://github.com/ManaManaFramework/manamana[Source in Github].


== One More Thing

Coding without tests is like driving a car without seatbelts so I always make
sure to cover my code with a reasonable amount of tests. Here's http://www.relaxdiego.com/2013/06/my-dev-setup.html[how I usually set up my Ruby projects]
and here's http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/03/my-dev-setup-python-edition.html[how I used to set up my Python projects] (Modified to use py.test and Tox since).
